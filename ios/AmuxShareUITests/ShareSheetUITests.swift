/// AMUX-4990. The one path nothing else covers: open ANOTHER app, tap Share,
/// and drive the amux row in the system share sheet.
///
/// Everything below the sheet already has tests. `AmuxClientBootstrapTests`
/// covers the parser, `AmuxClientLiveTests` drives the shipping client against
/// a real server. Both compile `AmuxClient.swift` into a test bundle and call
/// it directly, so neither can see what a user sees. The failures that have
/// actually shipped here are all of that kind:
///
///   - a hand-written `AmuxShare/Info.plist` silently discarded by XcodeGen,
///     leaving an extension with no `NSExtension` dict. The build succeeded.
///     iOS never showed it in the sheet.
///   - the row reading "AmuxApp" rather than "amux", because the share sheet
///     labels an extension with its CONTAINING APP's name and the app had no
///     `CFBundleDisplayName`. Found 2026-09-23 when Ethan went looking for
///     "amux" in the sheet's app list and did not find it.
///
/// The CI guard added for the first one checks the appex is EMBEDDED, which is
/// a weaker claim than "iOS offers it under the name people look for".
///
/// SELECTORS ARE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. Every identifier below was read out of
/// a live element tree on iOS 26.5 rather than assumed, because the obvious
/// guesses are all wrong here: the Photos grid has no cells (it is `Image`
/// elements with identifier `PXGGridLayout-Info`), those images are not
/// hittable so they need a coordinate tap, and `images.firstMatch` matches a
/// tab-bar icon rather than a photo.
///
/// PREREQUISITE the caller sets up, because a UI test cannot reach simctl:
///   xcrun simctl addmedia <udid> <some.png>
/// The worker-list test additionally needs a reachable server in the App Group
/// and SKIPS without one, so a rig gap never reports as a share-sheet bug.
