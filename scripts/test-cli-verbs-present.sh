# 2026-09-28: 2da26297 (amux order --url) rewrote `amux` from a stale copy and
# deleted `amux computer` (rung 3 of the ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md access ladder)
# and `amux browser profiles` (AMUX-5307). Nothing failed. Lanes found it four
# days later as "unknown command" and filed it as a failed rung (gs12-spend,
# mixpeek-override, 2026-10-02). A whole-file write is silent, so pin the
# verbs here: each needs its dispatch entry, its function, and a usage that runs.
