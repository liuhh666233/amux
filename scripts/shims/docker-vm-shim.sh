# amux docker-vm shim (DESKT-72). Installed by the amux server as both `colima`
# and `limactl` in ~/.amux/shims/docker-vm/, and put first on a worker's PATH
# when AMUX_DOCKER_VM=<profile> is set at the worker's worker, group or global
# scope. The same server code sets DOCKER_CONTEXT=colima-<profile>.
#
# Why: on 2026-10-01 eight lanes had each started a private colima VM (16 to
# 32G apiece). With five running the Mac reached load 116 on 28 cores, memory
# pressure 2 and 10G of free disk, and each VM held its own copy of the same
# Docker build cache. A rule in one repo's brief reached only the lanes that read
# it; this reaches every worker of every provider whose scope sets the knob.
#
# What it does: `colima start|create` of any profile other than the shared one,
# and `limactl start|create` of any instance other than colima-<profile>, is
# refused with a message that names the shared VM and the knob, and the refusal
# is logged. Everything else (status, list, ssh, stop, the shared VM itself)
# goes straight to the real binary. AMUX_DOCKER_VM_ENFORCE=0 at a scope turns
# the refusal off for that worker and keeps the routing.

amux: refused \`$1\`. This worker shares one Docker VM, colima profile '$want'
(AMUX_DOCKER_VM, set at its worker, group or global scope in amux).

Use the shared VM instead:
  colima start -p $want        # if it is not already running
  docker ...                   # DOCKER_CONTEXT is already colima-$want
Keep your stack apart with a Compose project: docker compose -p <your-lane> ...

If this worker really needs its own VM, set AMUX_DOCKER_VM_ENFORCE=0 at its
scope and restart it.
