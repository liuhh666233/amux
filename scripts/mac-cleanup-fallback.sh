# mac-cleanup-fallback.sh — run the cleanup tick when the amux scheduler has not.
#
# SCHED-465 fires scripts/mac-cleanup-tick.sh from inside the amux server, and
# the server is one of the first things to stall or restart when this Mac runs
# out of memory or disk: the rescue went down with the patient. On 2026-09-26 one
# of eight fires read "server restarted before this fire recorded a delivery
# outcome" (DESKT-58). This script is run by launchd every 15 minutes, needs no
# amux server, and does nothing unless the tick's output is older than the
# staleness window, so in the normal case it costs one stat.
#
# When it does run it uses the committed tick (origin/main, the same bytes the
# schedule runs) with the same knobs as SCHED-465, and files one board card per
# 24h saying the scheduler went quiet. If the server is down that POST fails; the
# log says so and the next fallback run retries it.
#
# Installed as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.amux.mac-cleanup-fallback.plist
# (StartInterval 900). Log: ~/.amux/logs/mac-cleanup-fallback.log.
